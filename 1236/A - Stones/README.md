Next $$$t$$$ lines describe test cases in the following format:</p><p>Line contains three non-negative integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$, separated by spaces ($$$0 \leq a,b,c \leq 100$$$) — the number of stones in the first, the second and the third heap, respectively.</p><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">In hacks</span> it is allowed to use only one test case in the input, so $$$t = 1$$$ should be satisfied.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><div class="section-title">Output</div><p>Print $$$t$$$ lines, the answers to the test cases in the same order as in the input.

Then she can take one stone from the first heap and two stones from the second heap, making the first operation one time. The summary number of stones, that Alice will take is $$$9$$$. It is impossible to make some operations to take more than $$$9$$$ stones, so the answer is $$$9$$$.</p></div>
