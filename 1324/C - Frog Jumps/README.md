## Problem Statement

<div class="header"><div class="title">C. Frog Jumps</div><div class="time-limit"><div class="property-title">time limit per test</div>2 seconds</div><div class="memory-limit"><div class="property-title">memory limit per test</div>256 megabytes</div><div class="input-file input-standard"><div class="property-title">input</div>standard input</div><div class="output-file output-standard"><div class="property-title">output</div>standard output</div></div><div><p>There is a frog staying to the left of the string $$$s = s_1 s_2 \ldots s_n$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ characters (to be more precise, the frog initially stays at the cell $$$0$$$). Each character of $$$s$$$ is either '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">L</span>' or '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">R</span>'. It means that if the frog is staying at the $$$i$$$-th cell and the $$$i$$$-th character is '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">L</span>', the frog can jump only to the left. If the frog is staying at the $$$i$$$-th cell and the $$$i$$$-th character is '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">R</span>', the frog can jump only to the right. <span class="tex-font-style-bf">The frog can jump only to the right from the cell $$$0$$$</span>.</p><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">Note that the frog can jump into the same cell twice and can perform as many jumps as it needs</span>.</p><p>The frog wants to reach the $$$n+1$$$-th cell. The frog chooses some <span class="tex-font-style-bf">positive integer</span> value $$$d$$$ <span class="tex-font-style-bf">before the first jump</span> (and cannot change it later) and jumps by no more than $$$d$$$ cells at once. I.e. if the $$$i$$$-th character is '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">L</span>' then the frog can jump to any cell in a range $$$[max(0, i - d); i - 1]$$$, and if the $$$i$$$-th character is '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">R</span>' then the frog can jump to any cell in a range $$$[i + 1; min(n + 1; i + d)]$$$.</p><p>The frog doesn't want to jump far, so your task is to find the minimum possible value of $$$d$$$ such that the frog can reach the cell $$$n+1$$$ from the cell $$$0$$$ if it can jump by no more than $$$d$$$ cells at once. <span class="tex-font-style-bf">It is guaranteed that it is always possible to reach $$$n+1$$$ from $$$0$$$</span>.</p><p>You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.</p><p>The next $$$t$$$ lines describe test cases.
