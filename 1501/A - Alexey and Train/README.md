Unfortunately, due to the bad weather, the train moves slower that it should!</p><p>Alexey took the train at the railroad terminal. Let's say that the train starts from the terminal at the moment $$$0$$$. Also, let's say that the train will visit $$$n$$$ stations numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ along its way, and that Alexey destination is the station $$$n$$$.</p><p>Alexey learned from the train schedule $$$n$$$ integer pairs $$$(a_i, b_i)$$$ where $$$a_i$$$ is the expected time of train's arrival at the $$$i$$$-th station and $$$b_i$$$ is the expected time of departure.</p><p>Also, using all information he has, Alexey was able to calculate $$$n$$$ integers $$$tm_1, tm_2, \dots, tm_n$$$ where $$$tm_i$$$ is the extra time the train need to travel from the station $$$i - 1$$$ to the station $$$i$$$. Formally, the train needs exactly $$$a_i - b_{i-1} + tm_i$$$ time to travel from station $$$i - 1$$$ to station $$$i$$$ (if $$$i = 1$$$ then $$$b_0$$$ is the moment the train leave the terminal, and it's equal to $$$0$$$).</p><p>The train leaves the station $$$i$$$, if both conditions are met: </p><ol> <li> it's on the station for at least $$$\left\lceil \frac{b_i - a_i}{2} \right\rceil$$$ units of time (division with ceiling); </li><li> current time $$$\ge b_i$$$. </li></ol><p>Since Alexey spent all his energy on prediction of time delays, help him to calculate the time of <span class="tex-font-style-bf">arrival</span> at the station $$$n$$$.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains the single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$) — the number of stations.</p><p>Next $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers each: $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i  \lt  b_i \le 10^6$$$).

After that, he departs at moment $$$b_1 = 4$$$. Finally, he arrives at station $$$2$$$ with $$$tm_2 = 2$$$ extra time, or at the moment $$$12$$$.</p><p>In the second test case, Alexey arrives at the first station with $$$tm_1 = 1$$$ extra time, or at moment $$$2$$$. The train, from one side, should stay at the station at least $$$\left\lceil \frac{b_1 - a_1}{2} \right\rceil = 2$$$ units of time and from the other side should depart not earlier than at moment $$$b_1 = 4$$$. As a result, the trains departs right at the moment $$$4$$$.</p><p>Using the same logic, we can figure out that the train arrives at the second station at the moment $$$9$$$ and departs at the moment $$$10$$$; at the third station: arrives at $$$14$$$ and departs at $$$15$$$; at the fourth: arrives at $$$22$$$ and departs at $$$23$$$. And, finally, arrives at the fifth station at $$$32$$$.</p></div>
