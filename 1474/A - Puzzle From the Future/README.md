<div class="header"><div class="title">A. Puzzle From the Future</div><div class="time-limit"><div class="property-title">time limit per test</div>1 second</div><div class="memory-limit"><div class="property-title">memory limit per test</div>256 megabytes</div><div class="input-file input-standard"><div class="property-title">input</div>standard input</div><div class="output-file output-standard"><div class="property-title">output</div>standard output</div></div><div><p>In the <span class="tex-font-style-tt">$$$2022$$$</span> year, Mike found two binary integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ (both of them are written only by digits $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$) that can have leading zeroes. In order not to forget them, he wanted to construct integer $$$d$$$ in the following way: </p><ul> <li> he creates an integer $$$c$$$ as a result of bitwise summing of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ <span class="tex-font-style-it">without transferring carry</span>, so $$$c$$$ may have one or more $$$2$$$-s. For example, the result of bitwise summing of $$$0110$$$ and $$$1101$$$ is $$$1211$$$ or the sum of $$$011000$$$ and $$$011000$$$ is $$$022000$$$; </li><li> after that Mike replaces equal consecutive digits in $$$c$$$ by one digit, thus getting $$$d$$$. In the cases above after this operation, $$$1211$$$ becomes $$$121$$$ and $$$022000$$$ becomes $$$020$$$ (so, $$$d$$$ won't have equal consecutive digits). </li></ul><p>Unfortunately, Mike lost integer $$$a$$$ before he could calculate $$$d$$$ himself. Now, to cheer him up, you want to find <span class="tex-font-style-bf">any binary</span> integer $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that $$$d$$$ will be <span class="tex-font-style-bf">maximum possible as integer</span>.</p><p>Maximum possible as integer means that $$$102  \gt  21$$$, $$$012  \lt  101$$$, $$$021 = 21$$$ and so on.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains binary integer $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The integer $$$b$$$ consists only of digits $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the total sum of $$$n$$$ over all $$$t$$$ test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><div class="section-title">Output</div><p>For each test case output one <span class="tex-font-style-bf">binary</span> integer $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$.
